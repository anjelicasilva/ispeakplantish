90,Ficus Benjamina,Weeping Fig,"
                                                        One of the best known and widely used houseplants. This is for a good reason, glossy leaves grow in profusion creating the classic indoor tree. Keep out of droughts and away from radiators to avoid the 'weeping' and keep the fig. Over winter it will need watering less frequently.
